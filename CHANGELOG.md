and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Policy engine**: dual thresholds (150 lines + 12 KB), 5 ban
  categories (binary, lockfile, minified, build output, secret),
  `.graftignore` support, session-depth dynamic caps (20/10/4 KB).
- **Parser**: tree-sitter WASM outline extraction for JS/TS with
  jump tables, signature bounding, and broken-file recovery.
- **Session tracker**: 4 tripwires (SESSION_LONG, EDIT_BASH_LOOP,
  RUNAWAY_TOOLS, LATE_LARGE_READ) with session depth reporting.
- **Metrics logger**: NDJSON decision logging with retention/rotation.
- **Operations**: safe_read, file_outline, read_range, state_save/load.
- **MCP server**: all 8 Phase 1 commands as MCP tools over stdio,
  session tracking (tripwires + dynamic caps automatic), doctor and
  stats tools. Entry point at `src/mcp/stdio.ts`.
- **Re-read suppression**: session-level observation cache — second
  read of an unchanged file returns cached outline instead of
  re-reading. Tracks readCount, estimatedBytesAvoided, lastReadAt.
  Works for both safe_read and file_outline. Stats includes
  totalCacheHits and totalBytesAvoidedByCache.
- 15 machine-stable reason codes (added REREAD_UNCHANGED).
- 169 tests across 15 test files.
- Repository scaffolding, METHOD structure, community files.
- Cycle 0001 design doc and retrospective.
- Cycle 0002 design doc: MCP transport.

### Fixed

- Add `@types/node` and `@types/picomatch` (required by TypeScript 6).
- Fix session-depth table in design doc ("Messages Remaining" →
  "Messages Elapsed").
